# Project 26 

In this project, I will share healthy,easy and delicious recipe of Poha Croquettes which you can make byself whenever you are hungry.Poha Croquettes are Indian Style deep fried balls made with flattened rice, cheese and potato. Perfect to serve as an appetizer or a evening snack.The croquette turned out just beautiful. A gorgeous ball which is super crispy on the outside. And once you bite into the crispy shell, you get to enjoy the mildly flavored soft and cheesy inside. And finally comes the surprise element. A super stretchy and gooey mozzarella cheese center. It is everything I want from a dish, a wonderful symphony inside my mouth ðŸ™‚.
